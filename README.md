CP416_SUSIE
===========

This repo has the source for the Android app that was used to control S.U.S.I.E in CSC 416 @ Cal Poly, Spring 2011
Upon reviewing the code, it appears that my local copy was out of date; This is not the final code used in SUSIE, and I can't garuntee that is correct (or will even compile!). I will work on finding the final, functional code that was used. I will update this readme if I do.
